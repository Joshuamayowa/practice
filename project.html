           <h2>Key Moment of Herbert Macaulay</h2>
           <ul>
            <li><strong>1864</strong> Herbert Macaulay was in Lagos colony, born  to the family of Thomas Babington Macaulay and Abigail Crowther. His parents were children of people captured from what is now Nigeria, resettled in Sierra Leone by the British West Africa Squadron, and eventual returnees to present day Nigeria.</li>
            <li>Macaulay started primary school in 1869 and from <strong>1869 to 1877</strong>, he was educated at St Paul's Breadfruit School, Lagos</li>
            <li>From <strong>1877 to October 1880</strong>, he attended CMS Grammar School, Lagos for his secondary education. He was a student at the school when his father died in 1878.</li>
            <li>From <strong>1891 to 1894</strong> he studied civil engineering in Plymouth, England, and was also a pupil of G.D. Bellamy, a borough surveyor and water engineer in Plymouth. In 1893, he became a graduate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, London. Macaulay was also an accomplished musician who received a certificate in music from Trinity College, London and a certificate in violin playing from Music International College, London.</li>
            <li>Upon his return to Lagos in September 1893, he resumed work with the colonial service as a surveyor of Crown Lands. He left the service as land inspector in September 1898 due to a growing distaste for the British rule of the Lagos Colony and the position of Yorubaland and the Niger Coast Protectorate as British protectorates</li>
            <li>Macaulay married Caroline Pratt, daughter of an African Superintendent of Police in December 1898. Their marriage came to an end in August 1899 upon Caroline's death during childbirth and Macaulay is reported to have vowed never to marry again.</li>
           <li>Macaulay was also a member of the Association of Babalawos (Ifa priests) of Lagos.</li>
             <li>Prior to the beginning of the twentieth century, Macaulay associated with many Lagos socialites, worked as a private surveyor and had a moderate outlook about colonialism. However, by the end of the 1800s, he had begun to veer from his professional and social activities to become a political activist.</li>
             <li>Macaulay was one of the first Nigerian nationalists and for most of his life a strong opponent of many colonial policies. As a reaction to claims by the British that they were governing with <q>the true interests of the natives at heart</q>, he wrote: "The dimensions of <q>the true interests of the natives at heart</q></li>
              <li>To further his political activities, Macaulay co-founded the Nigerian Daily News, a platform he used to write opinion pieces such as Justitia Fiat: The Moral Obligation of the British Government to the House of Docemo. He also wrote a piece titled Henry Carr Must Go. From 1923 to 1938</li>
              <li>In <strong>1931</strong>, relations between Macaulay and the British began to improve up to the point that the governor even held conferences with Macaulay. In October 1938, the more radical Nigerian Youth Movement fought and won elections for the Lagos Town Council, ending the dominance of Macaulay and his National Democratic Party.</li>   
            <li>Macaulay was barred from running for public office because of legal problems - he was convicted twice by the colonial government in Lagos; the first time for fraud, and the second time for sedition.</li>
            <li> <strong> In 1946</strong>, Macaulay fell ill in Kano and later died in Lagos. Macaulay's reported last words were:
                <q>Tell the National Council delegates to halt wherever they are for four days for Macaulay and then carry on.
                    Tell Oged to keep the flag flying</q> </li>    
        </ul>
